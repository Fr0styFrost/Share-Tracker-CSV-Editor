Simple program to remove blanks or empty cells from a CSV file

I designed this program to go through hundreds of CSV files and replace all the blanks spaces or empty cells with zeros.
The reason i needed this is because the program that imports the csv files would crash every time there was an error & would become very time consuming to try and find the specific sheet and cell that had the problem.
